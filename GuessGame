//Java Program of Guess Game
/*  
The "Guessing Game" is an interactive and engaging activity where a player tries to guess a randomly selected number within a given range. The player is provided with feedback after each guess, indicating whether the guess is correct, too high, or too low. The primary objective is for the player to narrow down their guesses and ultimately identify the correct number. The game often incorporates elements such as limiting the number of attempts, tallying scores based on successful guesses, and offering the option to play multiple rounds. The game's simplicity, coupled with the challenge of deducing the hidden number, makes it a popular choice for both individual enjoyment and social interaction.
